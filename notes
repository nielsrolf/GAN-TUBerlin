Report: Properties of GANs as feature extractor

1. GAN introduction

2. How can we invert a GAN?
- Gradient descent
- Autoencoder hybrid
- Comparison: gan vs autoencoder, why can the GAN encode samples much better than the autoencoder can generate?

3. Making use of the encoding
- interpolating
- filling image patches 
- negative result: interpretability
    - idea: starGAN to change only labels
*- linear classifier on z vs x space, connection to svm

4. Controlling properties of the encoding
- Use T-Approach to replicate image modes in latent modes 
*- Use an additional random discrete vector to replicate modes (does it learn to use them as lbel vectors?)
